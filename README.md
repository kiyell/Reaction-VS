# reactionVS
Reaction VS is a 1 to 4 player on same phone/tablet, reaction time game. It is available for free: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiyell.game.reactionvs.android

This was a game that was created using the libgdx framework. The primary gameplay screen is found at core/src/com/kiyell/game/reactionvs/TrafficPlayScreen.java. All other game types are extensions of this basic game. All of the programming, music, and graphics were designed by me.
